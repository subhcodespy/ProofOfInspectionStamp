# ProofOfInspection Stamp

## Project Title
ProofOfInspection Stamp

## Project Description
ProofOfInspection Stamp is a blockchain-based platform that securely documents and verifies inspection records for real estate or machinery. Developed with Soroban smart contracts on Stellar, it captures immutable, timestamped inspection outcomes and auditor remarks ensuring transparent traceability and trust across inspection lifecycles.

## Project Vision
The platform aims to increase inspection process accountability by providing an immutable ledger of verified inspections. This transparent recordkeeping promotes trust amongst property owners, machinery operators, regulators, and consumers by ensuring tamper-proof verifiable inspections.

## Key Features
- Inspection Record Registration: Secure addition of time-stamped inspection details.
- Verification Layer: Authorized verifiers confirm the authenticity of inspection data.
- Immutable Ledger: Records persist immutably on the blockchain.
- Detailed Remarks: Captures qualitative inspector feedback and conclusions.
- Query and Audit: Public retrieval of inspection histories for transparency.
- Access Control: Only authorized inspectors can register; verifiers validate records.
- Error Management: Prevents duplicate records and multiple verifications.

## Usage Instructions
1. Register Inspection: Authorized inspectors add new inspection records.
2. Verify Inspection: Verification authorities validate inspection authenticity.
3. Query Inspection: Anyone can retrieve and audit inspection records transparently.

## Future Scope
- Support multimedia attachments (photos, videos) for richer inspections.
- IoT integration for automatic sensor data recording during inspections.
- Mobile app for inspectors and regulatory reviews.
- Integration with compliance and certification authorities.
- Granular role-based access and delegation.
- Cross-industry adaptation for product inspections.

## Technology Stack
- Soroban SDK with Rust smart contracts.
- Stellar blockchain for decentralized audit trails.
- Cryptographic methods for secure identity and record validation.

## Contribution
Open to blockchain developers, inspection experts, and industry regulators for extension and audit of this critical transparency tool. Fork and submit pull requests.
